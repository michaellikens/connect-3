# How strong to update a states value when learning new information
#   Higher value (ex > 0.5)  - learns faster but can become unstable
#   Lower values (ex < 0.05) - learns more smoothly but will take longer to train
# Choose a value between 0.01 and 0.3 for state based Reinforcement Learning

# When you are making your new game in your team you will want to experiment with different values

# Discount factor: how much the AI should care about future rewards compared to immediate rewards

# For tic-tac-toe this means care more about making the best more each turn (closer to 0), or care more about winning (closer to 1)
# If too small the AI will not learn multistep strategies that take more than one turn to develop.
